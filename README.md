# Core-3-Quadratic-Placement-3QP-Placer
executing 3 Quadratic Placement (QP) matrix solves. One solve on the full-size netlist, and then executing one vertical cut, to assign half of the gates to each side of this cut, then one containment step on each side of that cut, then finally, executing the other two solves , one solve on each side.
